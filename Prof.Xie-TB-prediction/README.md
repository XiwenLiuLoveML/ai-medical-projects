The project with Prof. Xie is to find the optimal prediction model from logistic regression, tree-based model (random forest, XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Neural Network based models ( Multi-layer Perceptron MLP), multinomial naive bayes (MNB).
The job is to do binary classification. In total there are 47 variables with different data types. The label is a factor variable Death.
Run Data_Analytics_split.R before running any other specifical model codes.
