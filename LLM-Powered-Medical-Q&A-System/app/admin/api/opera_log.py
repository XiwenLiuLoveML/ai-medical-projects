"""
opera_log.py â€“ REST API for tracking system operations (admin use)

Overview:
This module defines basic API endpoints for listing, deleting, and clearing user operation logs.
Useful for auditing actions such as create/edit/delete performed by admin users.

Note:
This is a simplified demo version, intended for LLM-powered systems that include an admin backend.
Remove this file if the Q&A system does not need internal audit logging.
