# 🩺 LLM-Powered Medical Q&A System (Demo Project)

This project demonstrates the core architecture of a **Large Language Model (LLM)** powered **medical intelligent Q&A backend**, built with **FastAPI** and designed for scalable deployment.

> ✅ This repository is intended for **showcasing structure and capability only**.  
> 🔒 Core logic and proprietary components are stored in a private repo [`ai-private-core`] and available upon request.

## 🚀 What This Project Shows

- 🌐 **REST API for Medical Q&A**: powered by LLMs like ChatGPT, GLM, etc.
- 🔁 **Streaming Response (SSE)**: for real-time chatbot interactions
- 🧠 **Session Management**: multi-turn conversations supported
- 🔧 **Production-style FastAPI backend**: cleanly separated modules for middleware, routers, and logging
- 🏥 **Healthcare Application Scenario**: designed for clinical decision support and patient education

## 👩‍⚕️ Sample Use Case (for HR/Managers)

> Imagine a hospital integrating an internal AI assistant to answer staff or patient questions such as:
> - “What are the side effects of metformin?”
> - “Can I take ibuprofen after surgery?”
> - “Summarize this lab report.”

This project is a simplified backend simulating that assistant.
